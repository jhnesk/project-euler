Project Euler
=============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jhnesk/project-euler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jhnesk/project-euler)

Solutions to Project Euler problems written in Haskell.
This is done mostly for fun and to learn Haskell.

As publishing solutions is discouraged I will only publish solutions
for the first few, more or less trivial, problems. Solutions to these
are available from a wide range of sources and mine are probably far
from the best.
